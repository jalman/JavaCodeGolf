N lamps are placed in a line, some are switched on and some are off. What is the smallest number of lamps that need to be switched so that on and off lamps will alternate with each other?

For example, if 1 is an on lamp and 0 is an off lamp, [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] can become [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0] after 3 switches.
