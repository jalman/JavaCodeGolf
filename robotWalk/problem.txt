A robot is standing at the (0,0) point of the Cartesian plane and is oriented towards the vertical (y) axis. Then it executes some commands each of which is a single positive integer. When the robot is given a positive integer K it moves K squares forward and then turns 90 degrees clockwise. The commands are such that the robot never leaves the first quadrant.

Determine if there is a square that the robot visits at least twice after executing all the commands.
