This is the subset sum problem.

Given a set of signed integers, return True if there is a non-empty subset whose sum is zero and False otherwise.

Constraints:
- the list has at most 30 elements: 0 < |L| <= 30
- each element n: -100 <= n <= 100

Examples:
L = [-3, -7, -2, 5, 8] -> True (because [-3, -2, 5] sums to zero)
L = [-4, -7, 10, 6, 8] -> False

Input 1 (L) : array.integer
given set of integers

Output : boolean
if a subset with sum zero exists
