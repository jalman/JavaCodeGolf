A range-collapse representation of an array of integers looks like this for example "1,3-6,8", where 3-6 denotes the range from 3-6, i.e. [3,4,5,6]. Hence "1,3-6,8" = [1,3,4,5,6,8]. Some other range-collapse representations of [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8] include "1,3-5,6,8", "1,3,4,5,6,8".

Each range is written in the following format "a-b", where a < b, and the whole range must belong to the array in an increasing order.

Input 1 (a) : array.integer
sorted array of different positive integers, length <= 100

Output : integer
number of different range-collapse representations of the given array, it is guaranteed to be less than 10^9
