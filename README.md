# JavaCodeGolf
Solutions to some codefights.com code golf challenges in Java. I'm collecting the solutions that I find impressive, or that use a technique or hack that I think will be useful for future challenges.

I've left the problem statements exactly as they originally appeared on the site. Some of them are not written in perfect English, but I think they're all understandable.

Thank you to the CodeFights team for making their site and allowing me to collect these!
